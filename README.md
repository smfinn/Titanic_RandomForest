# Titanic_RandomForest
Honing a random forest for GitHub's Titanic competition to predict survival.

This code was originally developed as a Master's student in Applied Statistics at Loyola University Chicago, for a Nonparametric Methods course final project. My first attempt returned an accuracy score of 77%. In the future I hope to continue improving this code to increase my accuracy score as I learn more about machine learning and random forest modelling.
